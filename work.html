In the summer of 2013 I was a marketing intern at Cherry Republic in Glen Arbor, MI.  My responsibilities included creating nutrition labels, planning fundraising events, assembling a fall catalog, and working one day a week in the retail store.  </p><p>In the summer of 2014 I interned at Acosta Sales and Marketing in the Detroit area.  The majority of my responsibilities involved working with Kroger in the Michigan division.  I did both fieldwork and work in the office.  I was also able to do some work with Meijer and other smaller grocery chains in the Detroit area.  </p><p>In addition to my internships, I also worked at a Lilly Pulitzer retail store and babysat for many years.  I have continued to nanny in college.  </p> <p>After college, I hope to get a job working in the product innovation division of a big food company and one day I hope to open my own restaurant.  </p></div></body></html>
