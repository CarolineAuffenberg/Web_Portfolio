<h2> WELCOME </h2>
</p>
<p>
A 21 year old native of Michigan who is currently living in the City of Brotherly Love and enjoying every minute of it.  I am a senior Food Marketing and Communications double major at Saint Joseph's University. Someday I hope to open my very own restaurant but for now you can catch me in the hustle and bustle of college life.      
</p>
<p>
I think my biggest passion in life without a doubt is food.  Whether it means cooking or eating, I absolutely love it.  My favorite foods include crab cakes, mexican cuisine, cheese, bacon, peanut butter, and of course anything with chocolate!  Aside from that, I am an avid sports fan (especially Alabama football) and a bookworm.  I especially love the summertime and every activity that involves the water.  I grew up learning how to swim and sail at home in Michigan.
</p>
<p>
I suffer from severe wanderlust but hopefully in the future I will be able to travel and eat my way through a multitude of different places.
