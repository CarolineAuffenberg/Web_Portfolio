I attended Mercy High School in Farmington Hills, MI until graduating in 2011.  I will graduate from St. Joe's in the spring of 2016 after completing my fifth year.  </p><p>When I came on my tour at St. Joe's I realized almost immediately that it was the right fit for me.  Once I learned about the Food Marketing program, I absolutely knew it was a match made in heaven.  Food has always been my passion, whether it means eating it or cooking it, and I knew that I couldn't find a major that was more appropriate.  </p><p>At the end of my sophomore year of college, I realized that I wanted an extra challenge in my studies.  After investigating various majors and minors I discovered communications and decided it was a good fit with my Food Marketing degree.  That spring, I declared my second major and there was no turning back.  </p><p>In the summer between my sophomore and junior year I was fortunate enough to study abroad in the world's most beautiful place, Greece.  I am absolutely dying to return someday!</p><p>I am truly blessed each and every day to call this amazing university my home.  I have been offered countless opportunities that I would have never been able to experience anywhere else and met so many incredible people who have changed my life for the better.  I am sure that when May 2016 rolls around and it is my turn to walk across that stage, diploma in hand, I will be one sad girl but as for right now I am just going to savor every minute of it.  Go Hawks! </p></div></body></html>
